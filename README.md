# Web_App_Scraping
This is a free solution for web app scraping, allowing you to extract text from any platform.


# Creation of project step by step

## Phase 1: Initial Setup
### 1.Define Requirements:
○ Define the scraping needs: URL input, text extraction, NER.
○ Specify the output formats (CSV, PDF) and tools (pyppeteer, spaCy, pandas, pdfkit).
### 2.Environment Setup:
○ Set up a Python environment for the project.
○ Install dependencies: streamlit, pyppeteer, beautifulsoup4, spacy, pandas, pdfkit.
### 3.Download spaCy Model:
○ Download the spaCy model for Named Entity Recognition (NER).
○ Command: python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm.
## Phase 2: Basic Web Scraping Functionality
### 1.Fetch HTML Content:
○Use pyppeteer to create a function that opens a URL, retrieves HTML, and returns the content.
○Add error handling for cases where the page fails to load.
###2.HTML Parsing:
○ Implement HTML parsing using BeautifulSoup to extract text (e.g., paragraphs or specific tags).
○ Clean and prepare the extracted text for NER.
## Phase 3: Data Processing and NER
### 1.Entity Extraction:
○ Create a function using spaCy to extract named entities from the text.
○ Filter the extracted data by entity types if needed (e.g., people, places, organizations).
### 2.Data Structuring:
○ Store extracted entities in a structured format, like a pandas DataFrame, for easy export.
## Phase 4: Streamlit Interface Development
### 1.Set Up Streamlit UI:
○ Design a simple UI where users can input a URL, select the format for download, and initiate scraping.
### 2.User Feedback and Loading Indicators:
○ Use Streamlit’s spinner to show a loading indicator during data extraction.
○ Add feedback messages for successful data extraction or errors.
### 3.File Format Selection:
○ Implement a drop-down menu to allow users to select the download format (CSV, PDF).
## Phase 5: Data Export and Download Functionality
### 1.CSV Export:
○ Convert the structured data (DataFrame) to CSV format.
○ Create a Streamlit download button for the CSV file.
### 2.PDF Export:
○ Convert the data into HTML and then to PDF using pdfkit.
○ Ensure the PDF is downloadable with a Streamlit download button.
### 3.Error Handling for Unsupported Pages:
○ Handle cases where pages can’t be scraped due to layout or content restrictions.
## Phase 6: Testing and Debugging
### 1.Test the App on Different URLs:
○ Test various website structures to ensure the scraper can handle different layouts.
### 2.Validate Output Formats:
○ Ensure CSV and PDF files download correctly and are formatted properly.
### 3.User Error Handling:
○ Test for invalid URLs, network errors, and unsupported formats.
## Phase 7: Deployment and Documentation
### 1.Deploy the App:
○ Deploy the app on a platform like Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or any cloud service that supports Streamlit.
### 2.Documentation:
○ Write documentation explaining the app’s purpose, features, and how to use it.
○ Include setup instructions for others to install and run the app.
### 3.User Guide:
○ Provide a guide for input requirements (valid URL formats, entity types) and supported file formats.
## Phase 8: Future Enhancements (Optional)
### 1.Additional File Formats:
○ Add options for JSON, Excel, or even text files as download formats.
### 2.Scheduling Scrapes:
○ Implement functionality for scheduled scraping or automated refreshes.
### 3.Analytics Dashboard:
○ Create a dashboard in Streamlit for quick analysis of extracted entities, showing counts or categories.
### 4.User Authentication:
○ Implement authentication if access needs to be restricted. 

This plan provides a clear path from initial setup through deployment, with flexibility for future updates. Let me know if you'd like to focus on any specific phase!
